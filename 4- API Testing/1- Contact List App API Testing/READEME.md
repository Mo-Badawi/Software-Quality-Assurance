# Recreate README.md file for Mohammad Badawi's Contact List App API Testing Project

readme_content = """# 📞 Contact List App – API Testing Project

## 🧪 Overview
This repository contains the **API Testing Project** for the **Contact List App**, designed and executed entirely by **Mohammad Badawi**.  
It demonstrates a complete **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** lifecycle for RESTful APIs — including **test planning, design, execution, reporting,** and **traceability**.  

The primary objective is to validate that all API endpoints function as specified, ensuring **reliability**, **secure authorization**, and **optimal performance**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Postman** – API testing, scripting, and automation  
- **Trello** – Task and workflow management  
- **Excel / Google Sheets** – Test case design and RTM  
- **Word** – Test plan and summary reports

## 🎯 Test Objectives
- Validate **API functionality and reliability**  
- Ensure **authentication and authorization** mechanisms work correctly  
- Verify **status codes, response data, and error handling**  
- Confirm **data integrity** and correct CRUD operations  
- Perform basic **performance checks** to ensure responsiveness

## 🔍 Test Scope
### ✅ In Scope
Testing of the following RESTful APIs using Postman:

**Contacts APIs**
- `POST` Add Contact  
- `GET` Retrieve Contacts List  
- `GET` Retrieve Contact by ID  
- `PUT` Update Contact (Full)  
- `PATCH` Update Contact (Partial)  
- `DELETE` Delete Contact  

**Users APIs**
- `POST` Add User  
- `GET` Retrieve User Profile  
- `PATCH` Update User  
- `POST` Log Out User  
- `POST` Log In User  
- `DELETE` Delete User  

### ❌ Out of Scope
- UI/UX design and responsiveness testing  
- A/B testing or usability studies  
- Features not defined in the SRS document

## 🧩 Test Approach
Testing followed the **Agile Scrum methodology**, structured around:
- **Sprint Planning**
- **Daily Standups**
- **Sprint Review**

**Test Types**
- Functional Testing (Positive and Negative)  
- Authentication & Authorization Validation  
- Status Code Verification  
- Data Validation (via environment variables)  
- Non-Functional Testing (Performance)  
- UI-to-API Behavior Mapping  

**Tools Used**
- Postman (Tests, Environments, Collection Runner)  
- Trello (Task Management)  
- Excel (Test Design and RTM)
